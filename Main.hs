{-

this is a version of CeTA that can be used as a "post-processor" on starexec,
https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/stardev/User+Guide#UserGuide-Post-Processors

it is called with two arguments:
first: name of file containing solver's output, 
second: name of file containing the benchmark

note: contrary to what the spec says,
the first file contains stdin and stderr merged,
and prepended with timestamps.
